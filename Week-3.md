# Week 3: Distributed Systems Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe basic distributed systems communications mechanisms and how to handle failures
1. Write simple Java socket code for a client-server system 
1. Explain the basics of  TCP/IP and UDP
1. Explain why partial failures occur and why they make distributed systems complex 
1. Lab: Experiment with sockets in Java

## Module Outline

1. Communications
1. Partial Failures
1. Timing and Ordering of Events
1. Performance and scalability revisited

## Lab
### Sockets in Java
Every distributed systems engineer should have written some sockets code. [Here's your chance for street cred!](https://gortonator.github.io/bsds-6650/labs/lab-3) Along with some barrier synchronization and thread pool practise that should help with your assignments.
