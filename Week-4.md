## Labs
[Lab 4 should help you understand Lamport Clocks](https://gortonator.github.io/bsds-6650/labs/lab-4)
### Primary Key Considerations
[Lab 5 - Let's experiment with relational key schemes](https://gortonator.github.io/bsds-6650/labs/lab-5)
You'll be writing lots of data to a database in assignment 2, so we need to design our schema to support high volume reads.
