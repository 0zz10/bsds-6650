## Lab 9 - Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker can be used in clients to reduce strain on a server that is under heavy load, and to potentially enable a service to provide more stable response times.

If we think about this in teh context of our assignments, could we use a circuit breaker in 
1. the client, which could set a latency threshold and back off if thi sis exceeded
1. the server, which could time-out a SQL request that was taking too long (if you are updating synchronously from your servlet)

Take a look at your code and circuit breaker libraries. Teh Apache libray is probably the easiest to get started with, but choose any you'd like to learn.
Can you add a circuit breaker in your client, server, or both, and obtain better perfromance?
