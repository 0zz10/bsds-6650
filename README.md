## Overview
This course will cover the essential elements of distributed, concurrent systems and build upon that
knowledge with engineering principles and practical experience with state-of-the-art technologies and
methods for building scalable systems. Scalability is an essential quality of Internet-facing systems, and
requires specialized skills and knowledge to build systems that scale at low cost. 

## Course Delivery
This site contains all the informtion for the course, except the quiz questions.
Class will meet each week for 3 hour 15 mins. Classes will be a mix of lectures and labs.

## Course Book
The book for the course, Concurrency and Scalability for Distributed Syetms, is in development. 

The first 11 chapters should be progressively available online [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-and-scalability/9781098106058/).

You should be able to access this and all O'Reilly books through the library. 

## Assessment
* There are 4 individual assigments. They total 70% of the final grade.
* There are 4 quizes.  They combine to add up to the remianing 30% of the grade. The first 3 will cover the materials in the previous 3 week's classes. The last quiz will have questions that cover the whole course. Each quiz will be allocated 45 minutes and be available at the start of the class in which it is scheduled.

# Policies

**Late Submission**
If you need more time, come beg :). Communications usually give a positive outcome.
Without warning, you'll lose 5% of your final grade each day overdue. 

**Missed Quizzes**
Quizzes last approximately 45 minutes. If you are not able to attend and take the quiz at the same time as others, _you must let me know_ in advance. Failure to do this will result in a zero for the quiz you miss. 

**Do your own work**
You know the rules. Helping each other out is fine, but design and build your own system. Any unwarrented collaboration will result in a zero grade for the assignment.
