## Overview
This course will cover the essential elements of distributed, concurrent systems and build upon that
knowledge with engineering principles and practical experience with state-of-the-art technologies and
methods for building scalable systems. Scalability is an essential quality of Internet-facing systems, and
requires specialized skills and knowledge to build systems that scale at low cost. 

## Assessment
* There are 4 assigments, the first 3 are individual and the final project can be done in pairs. Each assignment is worth 18% of the final grade
* There are 4 quizes. Each quiz if worth 6% of the final grade.
* There is one individual written assigment that is worth 4% of the final grade.

# Policies

**Late Submission**
If you need more time, come beg :). Communications usually gives a positive outcome.
Without warning, you'll lose 5% of your final grade each day overdue. 

**Missed Quizzes**
Quizzes are held in class and last approximately 30 minutes. If you are not able to attend and take the quiz at the same time as others, _you must let me know_ in advace. Failure to do this will result in a zero for the quiz you miss. 

**Do your own work**
You know the rules. Helping each other out is fine, but design and build your own system. Any unwarrented collaboration will result in a zero grade for the assignment. 

**Come to class**
Most classes contain a lab exercise that builds on the lecture materials and supports the assignments. These are great opportunitie sto work with classmates and learn lots of complex stuff togther, with help from the TAs and maybe even me!!!
